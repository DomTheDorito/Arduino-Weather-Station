# Arduino-Weather-Station
Weather station using an Arduino, ESP32, and a variety of sensors


Foreword:
This project was a passion project of mine to achieve a few goals, mainly publishing the code to a local dashboard, and also publishing it as weather data to the APRS-IS network.
With that being said, all of those files will be in this repo. If you wish to only use portions of it, it will be addressed in the readme later on.

This is a work in progress, so expect this readme to change frequently in the coming days or weeks.
